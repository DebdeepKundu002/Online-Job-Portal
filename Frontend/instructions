1.Blockchain is a decentralized, public ledger that records transactions in blocks that are linked together in a chain. It's a shared, immutable ledger that can be used to track and trade assets, including financial assets, intellectual property, and more.
Blockchain works by: 
Decentralization
Control and decision making is transferred from a centralized entity to a distributed network. 
Immutability
Once a transaction is recorded, it can't be changed or altered. 
Consensus
New transactions can only be recorded when the majority of participants in the network agree. 
Cryptography
Each individual has a private and public key that they use to produce a secure digital identity reference. 
Blocks
Each block is a file that stores and encrypts information. Blocks are identified by long numbers that include transaction information from previous blocks and new transaction information. 

2.What is a Distributed Ledger?

A distributed ledger is a decentralized system that records transactions across a network of computers, rather than relying on a single central authority.

Comparison with Traditional Ledger:

Characteristics	Traditional Ledger	Distributed Ledger
Centralization	Centralized		  Decentralized
Security	Vulnerable		  Highly secure
Transparency	Limited			  Transparent
Accessibility	Limited			  24/7 accessible

3.explain the architecture of block chain

Node: A computer/device in the blockchain network, maintaining a copy of the blockchain ledger and validating/relaying transactions.

Transaction: The smallest unit of a blockchain system, representing value/data transfer between participants.

Block: A container for multiple transactions, consisting of a header and transaction list.

Chain: A sequence of linked blocks, growing as new blocks are added.

Ledger: A distributed ledger across all nodes, continuously updated and synchronized.

Cryptography: The security backbone, using algorithms like hashing and digital signatures to secure data and ensure tamper-proof transactions.
